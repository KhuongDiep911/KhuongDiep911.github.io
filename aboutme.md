title: About me
---
Hi, I'm Diep Giang Thuy Khuong, but you can call me Khuong. During my undergraduate education, I realized I had a passion for Artificial Intelligence, and want to use it to tackle real-world problems. This passion motivated my decision to pursue postgraduate education, leading me to enroll in the Master’s program after completing my Bachelor degree in 2021. Therefore, I hold a dual academic background, with a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering and currently pursuing a master's degree while working as a graduate research assistant at the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, Sejong University. My expertise includes 3D modeling and structural analysis using tools such as Solidworks, Abaqus and ANSYS. I am proficient in programming such as Python, MATLAB and some frameworks such as Pytorch and Tensorflow. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with Linux, ROS, and 3D simulation using Unreal Engine.

Regarding my experience, my research topic in Masters level is Vision-based Drone Obstacle Avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning. On the other hand, Delivery Drone Design was the topic of my graduate thesis in my undergraduate program.

My accomplishments include winning a Consolation prize in the Aeroday 2019 Aircraft Design and Control Competition (ranked 4th/11 teams). I was also granted a Scholarship for Standout Students with Disadvantaged Background by Kumho Asiana-Vietnam Scholarship and Cultural Foundation from 2019 until graduation. I graduated from university with an excellent degree and was in the top 3% of the best students in the Faculty of Transport (Top 4/150 students). During my Masters course, I completed a drone project that required the drone to navigate and avoid 5 obstacles along the way using Reinforcement Learning. My drone achieved a 90% success rate in simulation and 80% in real-world deployment on a Bebop drone after fine-tuning with real images. I also recently won the Outstanding Paper Award (우수 논문상) given by the KIPS 2023 Annual Conference (Korean conference).

In addition to my academic achievements, I actively participate in social activities to expand my network and enhance soft skills. I played a key role in organizing events such as the GALA DINNER - TET XA 2023, the 9th Annual Conference of Vietnamese Young Scientists (ACVYS 2023), the VSAK Sport Woori Bank Union Cup 2023, and the 16th Vietnamese Student day in Korea. For my outstanding contributions, I received merits from the Vietnam Embassy Korea, and the Vietnamese Students’ Association in Korea.

In essence, I would describe myself as honest, responsible, and resilient. When faced with challenges, I openly admit when I don't know something but proactively seek solutions. I am committed to meeting deadlines, and my can-do attitude enables me to thrive even under high-pressure situations. An example of this resilience is evident in my completion of the six-year drone project, overcoming unexpected setbacks and ultimately achieving success in navigating the drone through challenging tests (sucess 8/10 trials).

My life motto is: ”You only fail when you stop trying”
